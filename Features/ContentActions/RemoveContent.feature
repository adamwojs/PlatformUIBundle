    Scenario: Verify the existence of the removal confirmation request
        Given a "News Flash" article exists
        And I am on "News Flash" full view
        When I click on the action bar button "Send to Trash"
        Then I am asked to confirm if I am sure that I want to send the content to trash
        And I see a confirmation button
        And I see a cancel button
